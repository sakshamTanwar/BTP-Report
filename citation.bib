It highlights issues, such as minimal transparency, accountability, incoherent data sets with different Government Departments pertaining to the same piece of land and delays in the current Land Records management process and how to overcome these problems using Blockchain Technology. The paper describes the current process of land records maintenance and land registration in the country, and discusses various challenges encountered during the implementation of Blockchain Technology like public key infrastructure and Internet, privacy rules and security issues. Finally, the paper illustrates a system design using Blockchain Technology for the implementation of Land Titling system in the country, so that land titles are tamper-proof, and provides authentic and conclusive rights on ownership.}

    abstract = {Bangladesh is a small country with a large population. Its increasingly developing economy further makes land a lucrative source of fixed capital. On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh.}
